1. Read the Excel File:
   Load the sheet titled `FS Award Workflow`.
2. Identify the Header Row Smartly:
    Scan the rows to detect the header line.
    The header line is the row that contains both:
      One or more cells with the keyword `"condition"` (case-insensitive).
      One or more cells with the keyword `"approver"` (case-insensitive).
3. Unmerge Cells Below the Header Row:
    For all rows below the detected header row:  Unmerge all merged cells.
      Fill each resulting cell with the value from the top-left cell of the original merged region.
4. Check If any column (except columns whose header contains %Approver%) contains multiple values in a single cell, separated by line breaks (i.e., newline characters \n or Excel line breaks):
	Split the cell into multiple values using the line break as the separator.
	For each individual non-blank value, create a new row and replicate all other column values from the original row in each new row.
	Do not create a new row for blank lines resulting from the split.
5. Save the Resulting Data to workflow_processed_output.xlsx
