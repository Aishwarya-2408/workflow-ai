For this data extract a json which has all the levels in it.
Example:-
{
"L0":{
"name": "C&P CBU Director",
"description": "<Some basic description about this (single line) (The 1st level, 2nd level, etc and there some basic meaning as per the name and level.)>"
},
"L1":{....},
.....
}
L0 is the lowest level and with further levels being higher (in authority and approval amount, critical decisions).



---
Now fetch all the conditions from this data in a json format.
Example:-
{
condition1: {
"type": "yearlyContractValue",
"range": "0-3 million",
"description": "Yearly contract value: 0-3 million"
},
condition2: {
"type": "contractValueAndDuration",
"value": ">5M",
"duration": ">2Y",
"description": "All  contracts >5M and >2Y"
},
condition3: {"type": "contractDuration",
"duration": "> 5Y",
"description": "All contracts >5Y"
}
condition4: {......},
......
}

Similarly do extract all the unique conditions, but dont add duplicate condition (i.e. if a condition is already in the json which you extracted till now, and the same condition appears again then dont add such duplicate condition).
There might be a single sentence having multiple conditions separated by 'or' or '+' or '/' or similar.
There might be some that are related like having 'and' or similar thing showing relation.



---
Now, map the previously extracted conditions to the appropriate levels.  
Each condition might map to one or more levels.
Thus each level can come in one or more condition, so scan the conditions properly for each level and condition. 

Be EXTREMELY careful to consider the ENTIRE condition description when determining the level.  
If a condition description includes MULTIPLE criteria joined by "and", "+", "or", or "/", ALL criteria must be considered TOGETHER to determine the correct level(s).  
Do NOT assign levels based on individual parts of a combined condition.  

Output a JSON object in the following format:
{
  "condition1": ["L0"],  // Example: condition1 maps to level L0
  "condition2": ["L1", "L2"], // Example: condition2 maps to levels L1 AND L2
  "condition3": ["L3"],
  ...
}

Treat each distinct numerical range or contract duration as a SEPARATE condition, even if they appear within the same description string. 
For example, "Yearly contract value: >10 million - =25 million + All contracts >5M and >2Y + All contracts >5Y" should be treated as THREE separate conditions:
1.  Yearly contract value: >10 million - =25 million
2.  All contracts >5M and >2Y
3.  All contracts >5Y

Assign the appropriate level(s) to EACH of these SEPARATE conditions. 
If a level's description matches ANY part of a combined condition, include that level in the mapping for the ENTIRE combined condition. 
The output MUST be valid JSON.
Do not include any explanatory text, only the JSON.

I have also provided the 'Levels JSON', 'Conditions JSON' and 'Condition-Level Mapping JSON' to refer as context for the given data.
Objective:
Create a JSON object that maps procurement categories and subcategories to approval conditions and the users responsible for those approvals. The mapping must strictly adhere to the provided "Levels", "Conditions", "Condition-Level Mapping", and "User Data" JSON files. Missing data must be handled gracefully. Correct JSON syntax is paramount.

So it will be like:-
{
    "Region": { // e.g., NORAM
        "Direct/Indirect" : { // e.g., Direct
            "Category1": {  // e.g., "PACKAGING MATERIALS - Packaging"
                "SubCategory1": {  // e.g., "BRICKS"
                    {"condition-description": [  // e.g. Yearly contract value: >25 million - =50 million (You will get this from conditions json)
                            {
                                "user": <email-id from data>,
                                "label": "<Name from data>"
                            },
                            {
                                "user": <email-id from data>,
                                "label": "<Name from data>"
                            } // So there can be multiple users for a condition, this will be getting by the Condition-Level Mapping json.
                        ]
                    }
                },
                "SubCategory2": {  // e.g., "BIG BAGS"
                    {"condition-description": [
                        {
                            "user": <email-id from data>,
                            "label": "<Name from data>"
                        }
                    ]
                }
                },
            },
            "Category2": {  // e.g., "RAW MATERIALS - FOOD"
                "SubCategoryA": {
                    {"condition-description": [
                            {
                                "user": <email-id from data>,
                                "label": "<Name from data>"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

JSON Syntax Rules (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT):
Objects: Objects are enclosed in curly braces {}. Key-value pairs within an object are separated by commas.
Arrays: Arrays are enclosed in square brackets []. Elements within an array are separated by commas.
User Objects: Each user within the condition_description array must be a separate JSON object, and these objects must be separated by commas. This was the source of the previous error. For example: [ {"user": "a", "label": "b"}, {"user": "c", "label": "d"} ] is correct. [ {"user": "a", "label": "b"} {"user": "c", "label": "d"} ] is incorrect (missing comma).
Strings: All keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes ".

Processing Instructions:
Data Loading and Joining:
Load the Levels, Conditions, and Condition-Level Mapping JSON files.
The Condition-Level Mapping JSON acts as a join table. Use the level_id to link to the Levels JSON, and the condition_id to link to the Conditions JSON.
Also, map the user details by matching the "user" key in Condition-Level Mapping with "email-id" in data.

Condition Mapping:
For each level (identified by level_id in the joined data), find all matching entries in the Condition-Level Mapping.
For each matching condition_id, retrieve the corresponding condition_description from the Conditions JSON.
Create a key in the innermost level of the JSON (under the Subcategory) using the condition_description.

User Assignment:
For each condition_description, create an array of user objects.
Maintain the exact order of users as defined in the Condition-Level Mapping JSON. Each user object should have:
user: The user's email address (from the Condition-Level Mapping and data JSON).
label: The user's label (from the Condition-Level Mapping JSON).

Missing Data Handling:
In data if for any column the value is missing, NaN, pd.NA, Null, null, NA, N/A, None, Not Available, or empty, represent it as "N/A" in the output JSON. Do not skip the entry; the structure must be complete. Do not substitute with values from other fields.

Constraints and Rules (CRITICAL):
Strict Adherence: Use only the conditions provided in the Conditions JSON. Do not create new conditions or modify existing ones.
Complete Mapping: Include all levels (Regions, Direct/Indirect, Categories, Subcategories) from the Levels JSON, even if there are no matching conditions. Use "N/A" for missing values as described above.
User Order: Preserve the order of users exactly as it appears in the Condition-Level Mapping JSON.
No Data Skipping: Do not omit any data. Every level, condition (if mapped), and user (if mapped) must be present in the output.
Data JSON: Use the User's data for the user and label in the output.
VALID JSON: The output must be a syntactically correct JSON object. Double-check commas and brackets.
Case Sensitivity: Use consistent capitalization for "Direct/Indirect" as it appears in your input Levels data (e.g., all uppercase "DIRECT" or capitalized "Direct").
Example (Illustrative):
{
    "NORAM": {
        "Direct": {
            "PACKAGING MATERIALS - Packaging": {
                "BRICKS": {
                    "Yearly contract value: >25 million - =50 million": [
                        {
                            "user": "user1@example.com",
                            "label": "John Doe"  // From User Data
                        },
                        {
                            "user": "user2@example.com",
                            "label": "Jane Doe"  // From User Data
                        }
                    ],
                     "Capital expenditure: >10 million": [
                        {
                            "user": "user4@example.com",
                            "label": "Alice Smith"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Now with this below data I want to do some data transformation.
So the expected output will be like:-
[
{
"Condition": "Select_your_Region_to_request_approval=NORAM&&Select_DirectIndirect_Contract=DIRECT&&Select_the_Level_1_Macro_Category=PACKAGINGMATERIALS-Packaging&&Select_the_Level_2_Cost_Category=BRICKS&&Contract_Annual_Value_converted_Original>3000000&&Contract_Annual_Value_converted_Original<=10000000"
"User Rule": {
"user": "jennifer.petibon@danone.com",
"label": "Jennifer Petibon"
},
{
"user": "vincent.mainguet@danone.com",
"label": "Vincent Mainguet"
}
},
{.....},
.....
]

So in condition we have certain keys for which value needs to be filled by the json we have (I will provide again below).
The keys are:-
Select_your_Region_to_request_approval -> It means the region of that commodity   // e.g., NORAM
Select_DirectIndirect_Contract -> It means the value there is in data, whether direct or indirect    // e.g., Direct
Select_the_Level_1_Macro_Category -> It means the Category   // e.g., "PACKAGING MATERIALS - Packaging"
Select_the_Level_2_Cost_Category -> It means the SubCategory   // e.g., "BRICKS"
Contract_Annual_Value_converted_Original -> It means the yearlyContractValue (Here there can be less then and greater then both or any one as per our range) (Note convert the value to full number like >3 Million to >3000000, to 10 million, or -10 million to < 10000000, or 5M to 5 million, etc

If anything comes beyond this keys then generate/use appropriate keys as per the condition/parameter, but make sure not to skip anything just because it was not in the keys list.

Each condition id has can have one or more then 1 user rule, but can only have one condition.
So its like for each condition we have one condition id.
NOTE:-
Ensure to give complete conditions with each Available parameter being added in condition as per the data, dont skip any paramater that is avaiable in the given data.
