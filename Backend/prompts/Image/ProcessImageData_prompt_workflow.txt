Given the Input_extract , your task is to configure valid structured JSON data based on specific rules. Provide Output_JSON without explanation.

    ### Strict Extraction Rules:  
    1. **Identify start point and Ensure that every condition is accurately identified and processed.Ensure that no additional conditions are introduced.
    2. **Ensure correct sequencing** of conditions and approvers.
    3. **Preserve all text values exactly as they appear**â€”no modifications, no synonym replacements, and no reordering.
    4. **When dealing with flowcharts, Track only "YES" transitions** at decision points.
    5. **Identify all unique paths leading to "Approval"** while maintaining their exact structure and order.
    6. **When analyzing flowchart's Data, If a "YES" transition line contains decision point text beyond yes and no, treat it as a part of condition and merge it with `<condition_text>`.
    7. **Do not skip any approver.


    ### **Expected Output Format (Strict JSON Structure)**
    The response **must be a structured JSON array**, where each path follows the format:  
    ```json
    [
        {
            "Condition Serial No.": "WC###",
            "1_Metadata_Condition": "<condition_1>",
            "Approver_Level_1": "<approver_1>",
            "2_Metadata_Condition": "<condition_2>",
            "Approver_Level_2": "<approver_2>",
            ...
        }
    ]
    
    ### **Example  - Input_extract of Flowchart**
        ### Conditions and Approvers List with Transitions:
		
		1. **start:** Submit for Item verification
		  **Condition:** Check Item Type
        - **Approver:** Item approver 
        - **Transition:** 1
		
		2. **Approver:** Item approver
		   **Condition:** leads to (Item cost <  threshold)
		 - **Transition:** 2

        3. **Condition:** Item cost <  threshold
        - **Approver:** Yes (leads to Cost Reviewer)
        - **Transition:** 3
		
		4. **Approver:** Cost Reviewer
		   **Condition:** leads to Billing type
		 - **Transition:** 4

        5. **Condition:** Item cost <  threshold
        - **Approver:** No
        - **Transition:** Leads to Billing type

        6. **Condition:** Billing type
        - **Approver:**
            - Manufacturing: Item Manufacturing Centre
            - Selling : Selling Unit
            - Packaging: Packaging Centre
            - Payment: Payment gateway Authority
        - **Transition:** 5

        7. **Condition:** Unit1 < threshold 1st approver
        - **Approver:** Yes (leads to Requisition approved)
        - **Transition:** 6

        8. **Condition:** Unit1 < threshold 1st approver
        - **Approver:** No
        - **Transition:** Leads to Customer with required threshold



        ### Transition Values:
		- From "Submit for Item verification" to "Check Item Type"
        - From "Check Item Type" to "Item approver "
        - From "Item approver " to "Item cost <  threshold"
        - From "Item cost <  threshold" (YES) to "Cost Reviewer"
		- From "Cost Reviewer" to "Billing type"
        - From "Item cost <  threshold" (NO) to "Billing type"
        - From "Billing type" to respective approvers based on type (Manufacturing, Selling, Packaging, Payment)
        - From "Unit1 < threshold 1st approver" (YES) to "Requisition approved"
        - From "Unit1 < threshold 1st approver" (NO) to "Customer with required threshold"
        - From "Customer with required threshold" to "Requisition approved"
